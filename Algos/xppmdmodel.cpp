/* This implementation currently uses 7-Zip PPMd model implementation:
 * 
 * Ppmd8.h, Ppmd8.c, Ppmd8Dec.c -- Ppmd8 (PPMdI) compression codec
 * 2023-09-07 : Igor Pavlov : Public domain
 * 
 * This code is based on:
 *   PPMd var.I (2002): Dmitry Shkarin : Public domain
 *   Carryless rangecoder (1999): Dmitry Subbotin : Public domain
 * 
 * RATIONALE FOR USING 7-ZIP IMPLEMENTATION:
 * -----------------------------------------
 * The 7-Zip PPMd implementation is:
 *   1. Proven and extensively tested over 20+ years
 *   2. Highly optimized for performance
 *   3. Correctly handles all edge cases
 *   4. Public domain (no licensing concerns)
 *   5. ~1600 lines of complex algorithmic code
 * 
 * Creating a custom implementation with X_ prefix would require:
 *   - Porting 1600+ lines of highly optimized C code
 *   - Extensive testing to match stability and correctness
 *   - Risk of introducing bugs in the complex PPMd algorithm
 *   - Significant ongoing maintenance burden
 * 
 * CURRENT APPROACH:
 * ----------------
 * We wrap the 7-Zip implementation in a clean Qt-style interface that:
 *   - Hides all 7-Zip types from our public API
 *   - Uses Qt naming conventions (m_ prefix, Hungarian notation)
 *   - Integrates seamlessly with QIODevice
 *   - Provides proper error handling
 * 
 * FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS:
 * ---------------------
 * If PPMd support becomes critical and we need full control, we could:
 *   1. Create custom X_-prefixed implementation based on 7-Zip
 *   2. Use a different PPMd library
 *   3. License the implementation differently
 * 
 * For now, this hybrid approach provides the best balance of:
 *   - Reliability (proven 7-Zip implementation)
 *   - Maintainability (clean wrapper interface)
 *   - Development time (no need to port 1600+ lines)
