/**
  Introduction

  LZ4 is lossless compression algorithm, providing compression speed >500 MB/s per core,
  scalable with multi-cores CPU. It features an extremely fast decoder, with speed in
  multiple GB/s per core, typically reaching RAM speed limits on multi-core systems.

  The LZ4 compression library provides in-memory compression and decompression functions.
  It gives full buffer control to user.
  Compression can be done in:
    - a single step (described as Simple Functions)
    - a single step, reusing a context (described in Advanced Functions)
    - unbounded multiple steps (described as Streaming compression)

  lz4.h generates and decodes LZ4-compressed blocks (doc/lz4_Block_format.md).
  Decompressing such a compressed block requires additional metadata.
  Exact metadata depends on exact decompression function.
  For the typical case of LZ4_decompress_safe(),
  metadata includes block's compressed size, and maximum bound of decompressed size.
  Each application is free to encode and pass such metadata in whichever way it wants.

  lz4.h only handle blocks, it can not generate Frames.

  Blocks are different from Frames (doc/lz4_Frame_format.md).
  Frames bundle both blocks and metadata in a specified manner.
  Embedding metadata is required for compressed data to be self-contained and portable.
  Frame format is delivered through a companion API, declared in lz4frame.h.
  The `lz4` CLI can only manage frames.

/*! In-place compression and decompression
 *
 * It's possible to have input and output sharing the same buffer,
 * for highly constrained memory environments.
 * In both cases, it requires input to lay at the end of the buffer,
 * and decompression to start at beginning of the buffer.
 * Buffer size must feature some margin, hence be larger than final size.
 *
 * |<------------------------buffer--------------------------------->|
 *                             |<-----------compressed data--------->|
 * |<-----------decompressed size------------------>|
 *                                                  |<----margin---->|
 *
 * This technique is more useful for decompression,
 * since decompressed size is typically larger,
 * and margin is short.
 *
 * In-place decompression will work inside any buffer
 * which size is >= LZ4_DECOMPRESS_INPLACE_BUFFER_SIZE(decompressedSize).
 * This presumes that decompressedSize > compressedSize.
 * Otherwise, it means compression actually expanded data,
 * and it would be more efficient to store such data with a flag indicating it's not compressed.
 * This can happen when data is not compressible (already compressed, or encrypted).
 *
 * For in-place compression, margin is larger, as it must be able to cope with both
 * history preservation, requiring input data to remain unmodified up to LZ4_DISTANCE_MAX,
 * and data expansion, which can happen when input is not compressible.
 * As a consequence, buffer size requirements are much higher,
 * and memory savings offered by in-place compression are more limited.
 *
 * There are ways to limit this cost for compression :
 * - Reduce history size, by modifying LZ4_DISTANCE_MAX.
 *   Note that it is a compile-time constant, so all compressions will apply this limit.
 *   Lower values will reduce compression ratio, except when input_size < LZ4_DISTANCE_MAX,
 *   so it's a reasonable trick when inputs are known to be small.
 * - Require the compressor to deliver a "maximum compressed size".
 *   This is the `dstCapacity` parameter in `LZ4_compress*()`.
 *   When this size is < LZ4_COMPRESSBOUND(inputSize), then compression can fail,
 *   in which case, the return code will be 0 (zero).
 *   The caller must be ready for these cases to happen,
 *   and typically design a backup scheme to send data uncompressed.
 * The combination of both techniques can significantly reduce
 * the amount of margin required for in-place compression.
 *
 * In-place compression can work in any buffer
 * which size is >= (maxCompressedSize)
 * with maxCompressedSize == LZ4_COMPRESSBOUND(srcSize) for guaranteed compression success.
 * LZ4_COMPRESS_INPLACE_BUFFER_SIZE() depends on both maxCompressedSize and LZ4_DISTANCE_MAX,
 * so it's possible to reduce memory requirements by playing with them.

  These functions compress data in successive blocks of any size,
  using previous blocks as dictionary, to improve compression ratio.
  One key assumption is that previous blocks (up to 64 KB) remain read-accessible while compressing next blocks.
  There is an exception for ring buffers, which can be smaller than 64 KB.
  Ring-buffer scenario is automatically detected and handled within LZ4_compress_HC_continue().

  Before starting compression, state must be allocated and properly initialized.
  LZ4_createStreamHC() does both, though compression level is set to LZ4HC_CLEVEL_DEFAULT.

  Selecting the compression level can be done with LZ4_resetStreamHC_fast() (starts a new stream)
  or LZ4_setCompressionLevel() (anytime, between blocks in the same stream) (experimental).
  LZ4_resetStreamHC_fast() only works on states which have been properly initialized at least once,
  which is automatically the case when state is created using LZ4_createStreamHC().

  After reset, a first "fictional block" can be designated as initial dictionary,
  using LZ4_loadDictHC() (Optional).
  Note: In order for LZ4_loadDictHC() to create the correct data structure,
  it is essential to set the compression level _before_ loading the dictionary.

  Invoke LZ4_compress_HC_continue() to compress each successive block.
  The number of blocks is unlimited.
  Previous input blocks, including initial dictionary when present,
  must remain accessible and unmodified during compression.

  It's allowed to update compression level anytime between blocks,
  using LZ4_setCompressionLevel() (experimental).

 @dst buffer should be sized to handle worst case scenarios
  (see LZ4_compressBound(), it ensures compression success).
  In case of failure, the API does not guarantee recovery,
  so the state _must_ be reset.
  To ensure compression success
  whenever @dst buffer size cannot be made >= LZ4_compressBound(),
  consider using LZ4_compress_HC_continue_destSize().

  Whenever previous input blocks can't be preserved unmodified in-place during compression of next blocks,
  it's possible to copy the last blocks into a more stable memory space, using LZ4_saveDictHC().
  Return value of LZ4_saveDictHC() is the size of dictionary effectively saved into 'safeBuffer' (<= 64 KB)

  After completing a streaming compression,
  it's possible to start a new stream of blocks, using the same LZ4_streamHC_t state,
  just by resetting it, using LZ4_resetStreamHC_fast().

Q.Score is a measure of quality of the hash function.

It offers much better speed, but for 64-bit applications only.

/*! LZ4F_decompress() :
 *  Call this function repetitively to regenerate compressed data in srcBuffer.
 *  The function will attempt to decode up to *srcSizePtr bytes from srcBuffer
 *  into dstBuffer of capacity *dstSizePtr.
 *
 *  The number of bytes regenerated into dstBuffer will be provided within *dstSizePtr (necessarily <= original value).
 *
 *  The number of bytes effectively read from srcBuffer will be provided within *srcSizePtr (necessarily <= original value).
 *  If number of bytes read is < number of bytes provided, then decompression operation is not complete.
 *  Remaining data will have to be presented again in a subsequent invocation.
 *
 *  The function result is an hint of the better srcSize to use for next call to LZ4F_decompress.
 *  Schematically, it's the size of the current (or remaining) compressed block + header of next block.
 *  Respecting the hint provides a small boost to performance, since it allows less buffer shuffling.
 *  Note that this is just a hint, and it's always possible to any srcSize value.
 *  When a frame is fully decoded, @return will be 0.
 *  If decompression failed, @return is an error code which can be tested using LZ4F_isError().

 * The below switch allow to select different access method for improved performance.
 * Method 0 (default) : use `memcpy()`. Safe and portable.
 * Method 1 : `__packed` statement. It depends on compiler extension (ie, not portable).
 *            This method is safe if your compiler supports it, and *generally* as fast or faster than `memcpy`.
 * Method 2 : direct access. This method doesn't depend on compiler but violate C standard.
 *            It can generate buggy code on targets which do not support unaligned memory accesses.
 *            But in some circumstances, it's the only known way to get the most performance (ie GCC + ARMv6)
 * See http://stackoverflow.com/a/32095106/646947 for details.
